# Cloudflare Pages - Redirects and Rules

# Redirect www to non-www
https://www.deepfold.com/* https://deepfold.com/:splat 301

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Cloudflare handles this automatically, but explicit rule)
http://deepfold.com/* https://deepfold.com/:splat 301

# Mobile routing - redirect mobile devices to /m/* routes
# Note: This is handled by Next.js middleware, but you can add rules here if needed

# SPA fallback for client-side routing
/*  /index.html  200

# API proxy (if needed to avoid CORS)
/api/*  https://api.deepfold.com/:splat  200
